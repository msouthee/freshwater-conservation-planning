Ontario Northern Boreal - Prioritizr Analysis

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in a freshwater conservation planning analysis in Ontario's Northern Boreal.  

Specifically, it includes the PCA script to develop the cost index, the species matrix of predicted distribution for 30 freshwater fish species across 1417 watershed planning units, the watershed planning units shapefile and the Prioritizr analysis scripts used in 6 conservation planning scenarios to meet two area-based conservation targets (17% and 30%).

List of Scenarios:
1: Freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species)
2: Freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species) with protected areas locked in
3: Focal species scenario - Lake Sturgeon
4: Focal species scenario - Lake Whitefish
5: Focal species scenario - Brook Trout
6: Focal species scenario - Walleye
