This repository contains the input datasets and R scripts used in the aforementioned paper. Included in this repository are the following datasets: watershed planning units shapefile [planning_units.7z], input datasets for the freshwater conservation planning analysis [Inputs folder], R scripts for the cost index created using a Principal Components Analysis of human disturbances known to affect freshwater species [CostIndexPCA folder], and R scripts used to run the prioritizr conservation planning analysis using six different scenarios to meet two area-based conservation targets (17% and 30%) [prioritizr_analysis folder].

The scenarios are listed based on R script suffix: freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species) [No Suffix], freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species) with protected areas locked in [PA_LOCKED_IN], lake sturgeon scenario [SP01_Lake_Sturgeon], lake whitefish scenario [SP09_Lake_Whitefish], brook trout scenario [SP42_Brook_Trout], and walleye scenario [SP46_Walleye].


The prioritizr_analysis folder contains the following sub-folders: initial conservation planning analyses with targets ranging from 10-90% species representation [01_APU_ANALYSIS], results from the initial analysis [02_APU_Summarize], conservation planning analysis to meet the 17% area-based target [03_APU_17_ANALYSIS], results for the 17% area-based target [04_APU_17_Summarize], conservation planning analysis to meet the 30% area-based target [06_APU_30_ANALYSIS], and results for the 30% area-based target [07_APU_30_Summarize].
