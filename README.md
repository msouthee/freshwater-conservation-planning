Ontario Northern Boreal - Prioritizr Freshwater Conservation Planning Analysis Repository

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in a freshwater conservation planning analysis in Ontario's Northern Boreal conducted by WCS Canada. It includes a shapefile of the watershed planning units, the inputs for the freshwater conservation planning analysis, and the R scripts that were used to (a) develop a species matrix of predicted distribution for 30 freshwater fish species across 1417 watershed planning units, (b) develop a cost index based on a PCA of human disturbances known to affect freshwater species, and (c) run the prioritiz conservation planning analysis using six different scenarios to meet two area-based conservation targets (17% and 30%).

Scenario List:
1: Freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species)
2: Freshwater fish biodiversity scenario (i.e. 30 species) with protected areas locked in
3: Focal species scenario - Lake Sturgeon
4: Focal species scenario - Lake Whitefish
5: Focal species scenario - Brook Trout
6: Focal species scenario - Walleye
